DVD-Name-Replacer
=================
After adding an XML to the folder for windows media center, the name in WMC gets changed.  I do not want this.
I want the name of the file to be the name that I see in WMC.  To accomplish this, I do my best to match strings
both in the movie title (in the XML) and the file name, always prompting the user if the name should be overwritten.
